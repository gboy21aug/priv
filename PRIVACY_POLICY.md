## Privacy policy

Welcome My app for Android!

This is an Android app developed by Anime and Manga available on Google Play.

As Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (app preferences like theme, icons, walpaper etc.) created by the you (the user) is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.
